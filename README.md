# VoiceNotes

The goal of the project was to develop an app that creates notes based on recognized voice with the use of Python. A simple UI was created using tkinter.Â 
The user can start and stop recording audio, edit a note, save a note as a ".txt" file, and select the appropriate language (Polish, English, German, or Spanish).
Audio recognition was developed with the use of the SpeechRecognition library.
